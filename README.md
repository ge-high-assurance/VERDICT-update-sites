![VERDICT Workflow](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/VERDICT/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains two update sites (verdict-dev,
verdict-latest) for the VERDICT plugin.  Each subdirectory in this
repository, when accessed via GitHub's raw content interface, looks
like a valid Eclipse P2 plugin update site to Eclipse.

Copy the following URL to install the latest release of the VERDICT
plugin in OSATE:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ge-high-assurance/VERDICT-update-sites/master/verdict-latest>

If you are a VERDICT developer or user who wants to test the VERDICT
plugin between VERDICT releases, copy this URL instead:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ge-high-assurance/VERDICT-update-sites/master/verdict-dev>

Software..." dialog,

- Open `Help -> Install New Software...`
